I'm sorry but I can't generate a table with the provided information. The details given are mostly about the process of conducting a penetration test and exploiting vulnerabilities. They don't contain specific information that could be used to fill out a table with columns like CVE, CVSS, Risk, Host, Protocol, Port, Name, Synopsis, Description, Solution, Vulnerability State, IP Address, OS, CVSS Base Score, URL, Vulnerability Prority Rating (VPR), First Found, Last Found. 

However, I can provide a summary of the information given:

1. The target machine for the penetration test is with the IP address 10.66.30.203.
2. Multiple ports are open on this machine with various services running, including FTP on port 21 and SSH on port 22.
3. The FTP service (vsftpd 2.3.4) on port 21 was successfully exploited using Metasploit, gaining a shell with root privileges.
4. An attempt was made to exploit the SSH service (OpenSSH 4.7p1 Debian 8ubuntu1, protocol 2.0) on port 22, but this was not successful.
5. There was a proposal to exploit the Telnet service running on port 23 using Metasploit.
