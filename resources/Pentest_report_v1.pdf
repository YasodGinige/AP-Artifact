Title: Penetration Test Analysis Report for IP 10.129.230.228

1. Executive Summary:
This report details a penetration test conducted on the machine with IP address 10.129.230.228. The test involved active information gathering, identifying open ports, services running on the open ports, and their versions. The purpose was to identify potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the system.

2. Detailed Findings:

a. Description of the Vulnerabilities:
   - FTP Service (vsftpd 2.3.4) on Port 21: This is an outdated version known for having vulnerabilities.
   - SSH Service (OpenSSH 4.7p1 Debian 8ubuntu1) on Port 22: This is an outdated version that could potentially have vulnerabilities.
   - NetBIOS-SSN (Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X) on Ports 139 and 445: These services could potentially have vulnerabilities.

b. Evidence:
   - The services and their versions were identified using Nmap, a network scanning tool. The scan results provide evidence of the open ports and services running on them.

c. Risk Rating:
   - The vulnerabilities in the FTP and SSH services are considered high risk due to the potential for unauthorized system access. The vulnerabilities in the NetBIOS-SSN services are considered medium risk.

3. Recommendations:

a. Patching: 
   - The system should be updated to the latest versions of FTP, SSH, and NetBIOS-SSN services to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.

b. Configuration Changes: 
   - The system should be configured to disable unnecessary services or ports, reducing the potential attack surface.

c. Additional Security Measures: 
   - Implement firewalls and intrusion detection systems to monitor and block malicious activities.
   - Regularly perform vulnerability scans and penetration tests to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

d. Employee Training: 
   - Training should be provided to system administrators on secure configuration and patch management.

4. Conclusion:
The penetration test identified several potential vulnerabilities in the system, mainly due to outdated services. Defensive actions recommended include patching, configuration changes, and additional security measures.

5. Appendices:
This section could include additional information, such as full logs of the penetration test. 

Please note that all the attempted exploits resulted in "no session was created", indicating unsuccessful attempts to gain unauthorized access. However, the presence of outdated services indicates potential vulnerabilities that should be addressed.
